-first install python
-after that 

 # Create a virtual environment

>> 
>> # Activate the virtual environment
>> # On Windows
>> myenv\Scripts\activate
>> 
>> # Install numpy in the virtual environment
>> pip install numpy
>> 
>> # Run your script
>> python train_knn.py

after that run this command in your terminal : uvicorn app:app --reload
